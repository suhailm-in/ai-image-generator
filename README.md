# AI Image Generator

A simple and interactive **AI-powered image generator** built with **React**. Users can input a description, and the application uses OpenAI's image generation API to create and display AI-generated images.

> âš  **Important:** For security reasons, the API key must be handled in a backend service. Do not expose it in the frontend code.

## ðŸ”‘ API Setup

You need to create a backend server to safely handle requests to the OpenAI API, as exposing the API key in the frontend is insecure.

update the API URL in the React component:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://your-backend-url.com/generate-image", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: "Bearer  $OPENAI_API_KEY",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        prompt: inputRef.current.value,
        n: 1,
        size: "1024x1024"
    })
});
```
